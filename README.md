# Flock Party Display
## Background
Every fall, the students at my college host a club fair for new freshman, where the variety of on-campus student organizations(orgs) showcase themselves. They call this event the ["Flock Party"](https://www.stevens.edu/campus-traditions), as a play on our duck mascot.
Orgs fight for freshman's attention, all seeking the new student contact information so as to add them to the  to mailing lists, group chats, discord servers and the like. Orgs either displayed an editable spreadsheet or kept a collection of papers they would need to transcribe later.

As the President of SUMAC, the [Stevens Underground Music Awareness Committee](https://www.instagram.com/sumac_sit), I wanted an eye catching way to collect student data, without leaving a editable interface for all to view. It was also important to me that this data would "auto-save" thoughout the day

## Solution
I designed this application and GUI with PHP, HTML, and CSS to accept the student's name and email and save it to a local csv. At the end of the day, the CSV can be handed directly to the university org's mass email subscription service.
